# Explosions

`ValueWatchdog` is the single place where destructive protection is implemented. Every time a component arms a `ValueWatchdog` with `WorldExplosion`, it opts into explosions. The tables below list every such component, the explosion type (`machineExplosion()` = strength 3, `cableExplosion()` = strength 1.5), and what each watchdog monitors.

## Transparent nodes

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Large Rheostat (`LargeRheostatElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/LargeRheostat.kt` | Machine | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` uses `desc.dissipator.warmLimit` to blow up the block if the coil overheats. | Breaker trips as the winding glows cherry-red, emitting smoke while the control knob locks out. |
| Legacy DC-DC Converter (`LegacyDcDcElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/LegacyDcDc.kt` | Machine | Primary and secondary `VoltageStateWatchDog`s enforce their nominal 3.2 kV limits. | An internal crowbar fires, popping the replaceable fuse and leaving a char mark on the chassis. |
| DC-DC Converter (`DcDcElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/DcDc.kt` | Machine | Primary/secondary `VoltageStateWatchDog`s enforce whatever input/output voltage the inventory configures (up to 120 kV). | Controller dumps both rails into snubbers, throwing sparks while the outputs collapse to zero. |
| Variable DC-DC Converter (`VariableDcDcElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/VariableDcDc.kt` | Machine | Primary and secondary `VoltageStateWatchDog`s guard their respective rails. | Tap changer slams to neutral, arc horns flare, and the front panel flashes a red FAULT banner. |
| Thermal Heat Exchanger | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/ThermalHeatExchanger.kt` | Machine | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` clamps the exchanger’s core temperature to the descriptor’s thermal window. | Relief valves pop and vent steam particles until the exchanger cools back within spec. |
| Battery Bank (`BatteryElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/battery/BatteryElement.kt` | Machine | A `ThermalLoadWatchDog` explodes the casing if the pack exceeds `thermalWarmLimit`. | Safety vents hiss white vapor, the cabinet texture darkens, and the pack drops to a dead, high-resistance state. |
| Arc Furnace | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/ArcFurnace.kt` | Machine | A single `VoltageStateWatchDog` forces the arc electrodes to stay within 800 V. | Main breaker kicks, electrodes retract with a shower of sparks, and the hearth shows a charred texture. |
| Fuel Heat Furnace | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/transparentnode/FuelHeatFurnace.kt` | Machine | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` enforces the descriptor’s min/max furnace temperatures. | Combustion shutters slam shut, soot bursts from the stack, and the furnace idles behind a fault indicator. |
| Thermal Dissipator (Passive) | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/thermaldissipatorpassive/ThermalDissipatorPassiveElement.java` | Machine | `ThermalLoadWatchDog.setMaximumTemperature(descriptor.warmLimit)` detonates the body when it overheats. | Heat pipes boil dry, giving off smoke particles and leaving the fins blackened yet still mounted. |
| Thermal Dissipator (Active) | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/thermaldissipatoractive/ThermalDissipatorActiveElement.java` | Machine | Both `ThermalLoadWatchDog` (warm limit) and `VoltageStateWatchDog` (nominal electrical U) share the same machine explosion. | Fans wind down while controller LEDs flash red and the shroud shows a scorched overlay. |
| Heat Furnace | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/heatfurnace/HeatFurnaceElement.java` | Machine | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` enforces the thermal descriptor for the stone furnace. | Stone casing cracks, glowing embers drop out, and the UI flips to a thermal lockout state. |
| Electrical Furnace | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/electricalfurnace/ElectricalFurnaceElement.java` | Machine | A `VoltageStateWatchDog` watches the main load; its nominal voltage is set from the descriptor or GUI. | Heating coils sag, emit sparks, and the control relay opens with an audible thunk. |
| Teleporter | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/teleporter/TeleporterElement.java` | Machine | `VoltageStateWatchDog` clamps the power rail to the connected cable’s nominal voltage. | A corona arcs around the ring, the pad fizzles, and the pylons trip offline until reset. |
| Auto Miner | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/autominer/AutoMinerElement.java` | Machine | A single `VoltageStateWatchDog` enforces the miner’s nominal supply voltage. | Drive motors stall, smoke pours from the control box, and the boom folds into a safe pose. |
| Egg Incubator | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/eggincubator/EggIncubatorElement.java` | Machine | `VoltageStateWatchDog` watches the incubator’s supply rail at its descriptor-defined voltage. | Heat lamps pop with smoke wisps, vents crack open, and the heater disables itself. |
| Electrical Machine | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/electricalmachine/ElectricalMachineElement.java` | Machine | `VoltageStateWatchDog` monitors the machine’s `descriptor.nominalU`. | Built-in breaker drops out, flashing a warning lamp while the frame hums down. |
| Power Capacitor (transparent node) | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/powercapacitor/PowerCapacitorElement.java` | Machine | A `BipoleVoltageWatchdog` on the capacitor plates triggers the machine explosion on over-voltage. | Dielectric sprays white sparks between the plates, then the unit goes open-circuit with a darkened texture. |
| Turbine | `src/main/java/mods/eln/transparentnode/turbine/TurbineElement.java` | Machine | Both a `ThermalLoadWatchDog` (hot side temp) and a `VoltageStateWatchDog` (positive load voltage) share the same explosion. | Brake clamps engage, venting steam from the exhaust stack while the blades coast to a halt. |

## Six-node elements

| Item (class) | File | Explosion type | Watchdog trigger | Watchdog response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power Capacitor (`PowerCapacitorSixElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/sixnode/PowerCapacitor.kt` | Cable | `BipoleVoltageWatchdog` enforces the descriptor’s nominal voltage for the capacitor block. | Terminals spit sparks, pressure vents, and the block remains in-world but permanently discharged. |
| Power Socket | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/sixnode/powersocket/PowerSocketElement.kt` | Cable | A `VoltageStateWatchDog` keeps the socket at or under 300 V. | Faceplate arcs, the integral breaker handle snaps down, and the socket refuses to energize. |
| Emergency Lamp | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/sixnode/EmergencyLamp.kt` | Cable | `VoltageStateWatchDog` enforces the connected cable’s nominal voltage. | Ballast overheats, the diffuser flares brightly, then the lamp goes dark with curling smoke particles. |
| Lamp Supply | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/lampsupply/LampSupplyElement.java` | Cable | The supply’s `VoltageStateWatchDog` makes it explode if the power rail exceeds spec. | Buzzing stops, the indicator LED turns solid red, and the output clamps to zero volts. |
| Current Cable | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/sixnode/currentcable/CurrentCable.kt` | Cable | Both `ThermalLoadWatchDog` (warm/cool limits) and `VoltageStateWatchDog` (nominal U) arm a cable explosion. | Insulation scorches along the span, releasing smoke while the conductor jumps to extreme resistance. |
| Electrical Cable | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/electricalcable/ElectricalCableElement.java` | Cable | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` and `VoltageStateWatchDog` enforce the cable descriptor limits. | Outer sheath blisters with glowing segments and permanently high resistance along that segment. |
| Thermal Cable | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/thermalcable/ThermalCableElement.java` | Cable | A `ThermalLoadWatchDog` enforces the warm/cool bounds. | Cable glows dull red or frosts blue while hissing particles indicate that its thermal conductivity collapses. |
| Current Relay | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/currentrelay/CurrentRelay.kt` | Cable | The relay’s `ThermalLoadWatchDog` keeps its contacts below `Eln.cableWarmLimit`. | Contacts weld open, releasing a puff of smoke and freezing the linkage. |
| Electrical Relay | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/electricalrelay/ElectricalRelayElement.java` | Cable | Two `VoltageStateWatchDog`s police both relay sides at their cable’s nominal voltage. | Coils burn the window, a bright arc pops, and the relay stays stuck open under a red overlay. |
| Electrical Switch | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/electricalswitch/ElectricalSwitchElement.java` | Cable | Two `VoltageStateWatchDog`s watch the switch’s A/B loads. | Toggle melts toward a neutral detent and both sides disconnect like a tripped breaker. |
| Electrical Sensor | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/electricalsensor/ElectricalSensorElement.java` | Cable | When the descriptor is voltage-only, a `VoltageStateWatchDog` guards the measurement load. | Gauge needle slams to max, the bezel sparks, and the sensor freezes at a fault reading. |
| Energy Meter | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/energymeter/EnergyMeterElement.java` | Cable | Both sides have `VoltageStateWatchDog`s tied to a cable explosion. | Display blanks, the internal contactor opens, and soot streaks appear on the meter face. |
| Diode | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/diode/DiodeElement.java` | Cable | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` enforces the diode’s thermal initializer limits. | Package cracks, emitting a brief flash before turning into an open circuit. |
| Resistor | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/resistor/ResistorElement.java` | Cable | `ThermalLoadWatchDog` clamps the resistor’s warm/cool limits. | Body smolders with smoke particles and the color bands char black while it fails open. |
| Hub | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/hub/HubElement.java` | Cable | Each populated side gets a `VoltageStateWatchDog` wired to a shared cable explosion. | Internal busbars trip tiny arc-fuses, painting every populated face with scorch marks and isolating the ports. |
| Battery Charger | `src/main/java/mods/eln/sixnode/batterycharger/BatteryChargerElement.java` | Machine | A `VoltageStateWatchDog` forces the charger input to stay within its nominal voltage. | Charging leads retract, the fan surges then stops, and a red fault light blinks steadily. |

## Grid nodes

| Item (class) | File | Explosion type | Watchdog trigger | Watchdog response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grid Switch | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/gridnode/GridSwitch.kt` | Machine | Three `VoltageStateWatchDog`s (power, grid A, grid B) share a machine explosion when any line exceeds its limit. | Knife contacts arc violently, dropping molten copper, and all legs snap open like a tripped recloser. |
| Electrical Pole | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/gridnode/electricalpole/ElectricalPoleElement.kt` | Cable by default, Machine when a transformer is installed | The thermal watchdog always uses a cable explosion; the voltage watchdog(s) reuse that explosion, which is upgraded to `machineExplosion()` if `includeTransformer` is true. | Pole-top breaker trips with a loud arc while insulators glow; the structure stays but the circuit becomes visibly de-energized. |
| Grid Transformer | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/gridnode/transformer/GridTransformerElement.kt` | Machine | Both `VoltageStateWatchDog`s (primary/secondary) and the `ThermalLoadWatchDog` point to a shared machine explosion. | Buchholz relay dumps oil vapor particles, bushings glow, and the tank locks out with a persistent red fault ring. |

## Mechanical

| Item (class) | File | Explosion type | Watchdog trigger | Watchdog response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Simple Shaft (`SimpleShaftElement`) | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/mechanical/SimpleShaft.kt` | Machine | The `ShaftSpeedWatchdog` (from `mods/eln/sim/process/destruct/Mechanical.kt`) blows up shafts that exceed their allowed angular speed. | Shear pins snap with showers of sparks, the shaft grinds to a halt, and metallic debris particles linger. |
| Motor | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/mechanical/Motor.kt` | Machine | The motor’s `ThermalLoadWatchDog` ties over-temperature straight to a machine explosion. | Windings smoke heavily, the breaker thumps open, and the housing darkens while the rotor locks. |
| Generator | `src/main/kotlin/mods/eln/mechanical/Generator.kt` | Machine | Identical to the motor: a `ThermalLoadWatchDog` on the stator heat sink triggers a machine explosion. | Field breaker trips, smoke and steam blow through the vents, and the rotor coasts silently to a stop. |
