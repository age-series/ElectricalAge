 * automatically generated ingame help in the NEI usage screen, for example.
 * <p/>
 * For item drivers this will usually be pretty simple to implement, assuming
 * the driver only ever generates one type of environment - just return the
 * class of it and you're done.
 * <p/>
 * For block drivers there is a bit more work involved, since you have to check
 * if the item is the item block that corresponds to the supported block type.
 * This should usually not be an issue either, though.
