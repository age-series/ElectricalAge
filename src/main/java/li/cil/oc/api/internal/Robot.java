/**
 * This interface allows interaction with robots.

 * It is intended to be used by components when installed in a robot. In that

 * asked to create the component's environment.
 * <p/>
 * A robot's inventory contains component items and items in the actual
 * inventory. The physical layout in the underlying 'real' inventory is as
 * follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tool</li>
 * <li><tt>containerCount</tt> hot-swappable components.</li>
 * <li><tt>inventorySize</tt> internal inventory slots.</li>
 * <li><tt>componentCount</tt> hard-wired components.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that there may be no hot-swappable (or even built-in) components or
 * no inventory, depending on the configuration of the robot. The hard-wired
 * components cannot be changed (removed/replaced).
 * <p/>
 * This interface is <em>not meant to be implemented</em>, just used.
