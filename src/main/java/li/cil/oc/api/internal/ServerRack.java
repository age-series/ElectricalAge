 * This interface is implemented as a marker by server racks.

 * </pre>

 * Server racks <em>do not</em> serve as environment for the computer nodes of

 * The only purpose is to allow identifying tile entities as server racks
 * via the API, i.e. without having to link against internal classes. This
 * also means that <em>you should not implement this</em>.
