 * block that should interact with the mod's component network it is enough to
 * have it implement {@link li.cil.oc.api.network.Environment} - no driver is
 * needed in that case.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these methods should <em>not</em> be called in the pre-init phase,
 * since the {@link API#driver} may not have been initialized
 * at that time. Only start calling these methods in the init phase or later.
