 * A value object can be pushed to a machine like a primitive value.

 * This is the only non-primitive type that can be pushed to machines, allowing
 * for much more advanced interaction, since the methods on this value can be
 * called from Lua directly. This is similar to component callbacks, but at the
 * same time very different, because these objects can be pushed as results
 * from callbacks, therefore outliving their component, for example.
 * <p/>
 * There are a few limitations too keep in mind:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Values <em>must</em> have a default constructor for loading.</li>
 * <li>Values must be persistable (implement save/load).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Callbacks can be defined in a manner similar to environments, e.g. using the
 * {@link Callback} annotation.
