## Development

The **"base"** branch, is where commits during development are integrated into. It is where our team pushes or merges
their actual changes together and where contributions from the community (Pull requests) are integrated into the
development version of the mod. Anyone who wish to try the cutting edge version of Electrical Age can download the
develop branch and build the mod for themselves.

Pull requests are always merged into the **"base"** branch. If you are willing to contribute, make sure sending us
pull requests against the develop branch.

## Translations

Is the mod not available in your language or are some translations missing?
Well you can change that by adding or modifying a translation! Just ask us how you can help!

Some translation strings might contain placeholders for runtime arguments in order to include numbers or other runtime
objects into the sentence. These are identified by **%N$** whereas *N* is the number of the argument in the argument
list (at runtime). A translation string should include these placeholders too at the appropriate position in the text.
